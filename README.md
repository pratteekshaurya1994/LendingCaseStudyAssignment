## Introduction  
This project involves analyzing and exploring a loan dataset to extract meaningful insights and prepare the data for further modeling or visualization. The data contains a variety of borrower-related, loan-related, and credit history information.

---

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project is `loan.csv`. Some of the key fields include:  
- **`loan_amnt`**: The amount of loan applied for.  
- **`int_rate`**: Interest rate for the loan.  
- **`emp_length`**: Length of employment in years.  
- **`grade`**: Loan grade assigned.  
- **`loan_status`**: The current status of the loan.  

The data dictionary provides detailed information about each field.

## Objective  
1. Clean the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.  
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations.  
3. Prepare a refined dataset for further use in predictive modeling or business decision-making.

## Results
Key observations from the analysis:

- The majority of loans are graded as B and C.
- Most borrowers have employment lengths between 1 to 10 years.
- A significant portion of loans have a status of "Fully Paid."

## Technologies Used

- Python: Core programming language.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: For documenting and running the analysis interactively.
